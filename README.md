### Introduction



The origina code is from 

[GitHub - openscenegraph/osgQt](https://github.com/openscenegraph/osgQt)

However, the problem with this library is that some old tutorials are not compatible with this package.

Thus I updated this package for myself to make it compatible with various existing applications available in the internet.

NOTE: I didn't make any change to the CMakeList.txt file, and some file are just directly added to the dll project such as

GraphicsWindowEx

GraphicsWindowEx.cpp

You can directly find these files in the source location.
